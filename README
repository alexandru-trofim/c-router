Router-ul este implementat in functia router.c: 
    Explicatie: 
    
    while(1) {
        receive packet
        if packet is arp {
            if packet is arp request {
                send arp reply
            } else if reply {
                add arp_entry to arp_table
                while(packet queue not empty) {
                    check if packet dest addr is equal with new arp_entry address
                    if true {
                        send packet
                    } else {
                        add packet to a new queue
                    }
                }
                old queue = new queue
            }
        } else if packet is ipv4 {
            if destination is router {
                create icmp response and send to the sender
            }

            compute checksum
            drop packes if checksum is bad 

            find next hop 

            if next hop not found {
                send icmp destination unreachable
            }

            compute new checksum

            find mac of next hop

            if mac not found {
                send arp request to find the mac 
            }

            send packet;
        }
    }

LPM is implemented with trie structure as in the link below
